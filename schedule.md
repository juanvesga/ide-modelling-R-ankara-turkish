| 1 | 9.45 – 10:45 AM    | Lecture:  Introduction to R 1    | Familiarise with the R language and the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Questions such as “why R?” will be discussed, in comparison to other programming languages used for epidemiological data analysis |
| 1 | 10:45 – 11:15 AM    | **Break** |  |
| 1 | 11:15 – 12:30 PM | Lecture:  Introduction to R 2 | A technical overview of some of the basic data structures, packages and file manipulation procedures will also be covered, as well as help functions and other tips for helping participants independently explore R’s functionalities |
| 1 | 12:30 – 1:45 PM | **Lunch Break** |  |
| 1 | 1:45 – 3:00 PM    | Practical: Using R | Setting up R and R studio, explore initial demonstration |
| 1 | 3:00 – 3:30 PM    | **Break** |  |
| 1 | 3:30 – 4:30 PM    | Practical: Using R (continued)    | Explore data structures, basic operations, functions, |
|  |  | **Day 2: Introduction to modelling infectious disease** |  |
| **Day** | **Time** | **Session** | **Aims** |
| 2 | 9.30 – 10:30 AM    | Lecture:  Introduction to modelling infectious diseases    | Introduce to core concepts of infectious diseases dynamics and the use of mathematical systems to simulate transmission |
| 2 | 10:30 – 11:00 AM | **Break** |  |
| 2 | 11:00 – 12:30 AM | Lecture:  Basic   concepts of compartmental models     | In this session we will go step by step in the process of designing a compartmental model. We will apply concepts of probability, proportions, hazard rates and competing hazards. We will also discuss alternatives for capturing disease events and interventions. |
| 2 | 12:30 – 1:45 PM | **Lunch Break** |  |
| 2 | 1:45 – 3:00 PM    | Practical:  Demonstration   of a simple compartmental model    | A brief demonstration of a simple compartmental model. |
| 2 | 3:00 – 3:30 PM   | **Break** |  |
| 2 | 3:30 – 4:30 PM | Practical: Demonstration of a simple compartmental   model (continued)  | Participants coding their own cohort model Rate calculations and interpretation of model output will be put in practice.   |
|  |  | **Day 3: The SIR model** |  |
| **Day** | **Time** | **Session** | **Aims** |
| 3 | 9.30 – 10:30 AM    | Lecture:  The SIR model     | Understand why the SIR model is at the core of infectious disease dynamics. In its simplicity, SIR models are the gate to introduce more complex concepts like the basic reproductive number (R0) and herd immunity. |
| 3 | 10:30 – 11:00 AM    | **Break** |  |
| 3 | 11:00 – 12:30 AM    | Lecture:  Understanding   epidemic phases with a SIR model    | Cover the mathematical expressions governing the SIR model. In practice, we will use R to understand an SIR model, understanding model variables, and model parameters. |
| 3 | 12:30 – 1:45 PM    | **Lunch Break** |  |
| 3 | 1:45 – 3:00 PM    | Practical: Building blocks of a SIR    | Participants will code an SIR model and will gather information to inform the main model parameters. |
| 3 | 3:00 – 3:30 PM    | **Break** |  |
| 3 | 3:30 – 4:30 PM    | Practical: Introducing transmission dynamics    | Using the previously coded SIR model we will add complexity by examining the role of R0, Reff and see practically how herd immunity can be established for a simple SIR model |
|  |  | **Day 4: Stochastic models and assessing uncertainty** |  |
| **Day** | **Time** | **Session** | **Aims** |
| 4 | 9.30 – 10:30 AM    | Lecture:  Introduction to stochastic models 1    | Introduce concepts of stochasticity and its relevance for understanding epidemic surge and   probability of extinction     |
| 4 | 10:30 – 11:00 AM    | **Break** |  |
| 4 | 11:00   – 12:30 AM    | Lecture:  Introduction to stochastic models 2    | Cover types of stochastic models and modelling procedures    |
| 4 | 12:30 – 1:45 PM    | **Lunch Break** |  |
| 4 | 1:45   – 3:00 PM    | Lecture:  Assessing   model uncertainty and calibration    | Explore uncertainty and methods to assess it in modelling    |
| 4 | 3:00 – 3:30 PM    | **Break** |  |
| 4 | 3:30 – 4:30 PM    | Practical: Explore stochasticity in a simple SIR model    | Using a simple SIR model coded before, a stochastic process will be introduced and its output explored.     |

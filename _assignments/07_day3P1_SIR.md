By now we know how to code a compartmental model. We also know what an SIR model is and what are its main building blocks. In this exercise we will build on our previous code to construct a fully dynamic SIR model.   
 
## 1. Building an SIR model 
 
 
### Case study: a new virus X2021 has been identified in your town and is currently causing an outbreak. You have been commissioned by WHO to provide modelling projections to have a broad idea of the potential size of this outbreak. The ongoing epidemiological investigation have identified the following facts that might guide you in your model development:    
 
1)	The virus transmits from human to human via micro droplets from the respiratory tract.    
 
2)	Once infection is established infected individuals remain infectious for an average period of 6 days    
 
3)	From a previous outbreak of X2021 in a neighboring town we know that the CFR is ~15%    
 
4)	No known factors have been identified for increased susceptibility in any particular population group   
 
5)	From the same previous outbreak, an infection rate of 0.5 per day (CI95% 0.3 to 0.6) has been estimated
Task: Using the code below (from our previous session) build an SIR model that reflects the case above and try to answer the following questions, providing a :   
 
    1)	When do we expect the X2021 outbreak to peak (in days) ?
    2)	How many people do we expect to get infected at the end of the outbreak?
    3)	Can you provide a range for the final size of the epidemic (number infected)  and the expected peak (in days) based in the uncertainty around the infection rate?
 
 
Note: Copy the code below into your R Studio session. Try to fill the gaps marked with ??

## Analysis of SIR assumptions
 
Think about the main assumptions and concepts reviewed in our lesson and try to answer:   
 
1)	Why is the homogeneous assumption of risk of infection a simplification and what factors can affect this? What are potential sources of heterogeneity?   
 
2)	What factors might affect our assumption of a homogeneous p across the population?
